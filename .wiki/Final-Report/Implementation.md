Over the course of developing Devote, our team has come up with a list of practices used to ensure that implementation is clear and consistent.

- [ ] Write tests before creating a class (i.e., Test-Driven Development)
- [ ] Avoid committing directly to master
- [ ] Create feature branches for each issue
- [ ] Use a standard naming convention for branches (i.e., issue-x-branch-title)
- [ ] Create merge requests for branches with at least one other developer as a reviewer
- [ ] Provide feedback and enforce implementation standards during code review
- [ ] Enforce a code freeze before a sprint demo
- [ ] Review code style/formatting to ensure consistency

Although not all of these practices were enforced throughout the software development process, this list helps to provide a guideline for the standards and expectations of the application.

Note: For future development, code style/formatting can be more rigorously enforced through the use of static code analysis tools such as linters (e.g., ktlint).
