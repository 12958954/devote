# Devote

#### A note-taking application for developers

Devote is built by developers, for developers. Our vision is to have an application that is quick and easy to use. Say goodbye to complex bloatware and hello to Devote!

## Wiki

To learn more about our project, you can check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/12958954/devote/wiki)! There you'll find detailed information for our software development process including:

* Meeting minutes
* Pages for each stage of the project e.g. architecture diagrams.
* Sprint summary pages, listing the major goals and issues that were addressed, and installers for each sprint.

## Issues and Milestones

We use [Issues](https://github.com/12958954/devote/blob/main/issues.png) to track the work to be done (where an issue represents an assignable task, which may be a new feature, change to an existing feature, or a bug fix). [Milestones](https://github.com/12958954/devote/blob/main/milestones.png) are a way of grouping issues into Sprints.

* Unassigned issues represent our Product Backlog
* Issues are generally assigned to a sprint during the sprint kickoff meeting
* We have milestones for Sprint 1 through Sprint 3
