## Description

This is a group project for CS 398 in Winter 2022 term.

We developed an amazing note taking desktop application for software developers and CS students. It has text formatting, folder structure, bullet points and checklists these some basic tools, and most importantly code snippet.

## Process & SDLC

The project is broken down into 5 phases.
Phase 1, Planning and Requirements. We determined our initial plan and identified the project requirements by conducting user interviews. We also created user personas and affinity diagram.
Phase 2, Analysis and Design. We analyzed the project by identifying technical impact and constraints. Also, we created its system diagram and prototypes and collected user feedbacks on prototypes. Finally, we decided our design patterns.
Phase 3, Spring 1. This sprint ran for 2 weeks. It concluded with a sprint demo.
Phase 4, Spring 2. This sprint ran for 2 weeks. It concluded with a sprint demo.
Phase 5, Spring 3. This sprint ran for 2 weeks. It concluded with a sprint demo.

## Project Tracking

We created issues for each requirement and assigned it to one of the group members. 3 milestones were created for 3 sprints and each issue went to one of the milestones. Once someone has done their implementation and testing, they will request someone else to do the code review. The code reviewer checks the code and performs their own testing. Once the review is done, a merge request will be initiated and the issue will be closed. In this way, everyone can clearly see the project progress on its repository so the project is easy to be tracked.

We meet 3 to 4 times a week depending on whether there is a demo at the end of the week. A stand-up meeting is conducted at the beginning of each meeting, where each group member reports what they have done since the last meeting, what they will do and what blockers are there in the progress.
